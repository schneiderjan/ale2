to copy middle list view have the application window selected and do ctrl + C
to copy right list view have the application window selected and do ctrl + X

In assigment 5 only the first transition after an epsilon transition is considered.
I kept assignment 6 the same "difficult" solution since i had to shift focus onto reworking ass.5 completely.
